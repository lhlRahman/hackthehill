# Enjoy Self-Accountability
## Paw_sitivity

An web-application that allows a user to set a 'mission' for themselves. These missions will have certain locations that are associated with them (ex: gym for fitness, library for studying, etc). The application tracks the user's position and when they reach the associated location, they are rewarded for completing the mission. 

Alongside, the user will have a virtual companion that interacts with the points earned to add further legitmacy to your achievements.
